# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project is a system that allows users to practice online driving tests and review other support documents. The client was a company that wanted to create a better learning experience for new drivers by providing extra resources and training to those individuals. They wanted a Web based system that had the ability to view downloaded information offline. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I think I created the documentation well for this project. I was able to gather all the clients requests and articulate these thoughts to the development team in a digestible manner. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I would redo the Gannt document. The scale was a bit off and could be confusing for someone to review. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I would understand what they're trying to achieve and translate that into tangible actions that the system can perform. It's essential to consider the user's needs when developing to ensure you create the correct product. If not, you could lose time, money, and the clients trust if the project is wrong. 

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When I design software, I review the clients requests and needs first. From there I design documents to illustrate the process and/or classes that will make up the system. Then I can begin creating the system and ensure that I've followed the clients’ requests and am not missing anything. I think in the future I would use more sequence diagrams as they are able to convey the moving parts of the system while still proving a holistic view.
